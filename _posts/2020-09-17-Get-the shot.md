Doing nearly anything creative isn't about the tools. Don't get me wrong, I love the tools I have. But the experience of being stretched by not always having the right tools can pull some truly creative work out of you.

Don't wait to get out there because you don't have the right tools. Just go be creative and augment your experience with life lessons, and learn from helping other people, and you will pick up some great tools along the way.
