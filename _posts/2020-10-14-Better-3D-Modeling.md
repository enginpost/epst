For a long time now I have been working on learning how to model and animate in 3D. While I have used my 3D skills to create lower-thirds for video and fun little animations, for the most part I have not mastered basic character modeling from scratch nor have I made detailed animations. Typically, I employ a number of tricks to keep things silly and simple to avoid those details.

I recently found an incredible tutorial series that using the Blender 3D environment for modeling, texturing, rigging, and animation. Blender has been my tool of choice for a very long time and I am pretty excited about it. Below are a couple examples of the work from the tutorial for creating basic human models from scratch that deform nicely when being animated.

I should mention that I didn't create the actual animations. The model is mine, from scratch, but the model was uploaded to a site called maximo.com that allows you to apply animations to your models. The nice thing here is that you can quickly take a look at your human rig to see if it is bending nicely in all the right places.

## Low-Poly Version 1

_You can see here the the basic model is deforming and bending nicely for the animation. But there isn't much definition to the character. There are no hands yet or head to the character. It could become a male or female. And the knees and elbows are just generic bends. The character here is essentially box modeled so we get a clean topology on the core body right from the start._

## Low-Poly Version 2

_Still no head or hands. But the body has a bit more definition. The butt looks more like a rump. The elbows and knees have a little more definition. The legs look more defined. The shoulders look more human and deform a bit better. The waist and hips look more like human movement. For this model we did more smoothing and sculpting of the box-modeled character without adding poly counts. This makes the model look better without bogging down the computer doing the creating or animating._

(I will add more progress to this over time as I move through the tutorials and build out my character.)
