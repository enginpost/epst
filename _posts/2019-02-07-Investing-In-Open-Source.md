Blender is a piece of software I use to create 3D stuff. Whether I am trying to design something to print out on my 3D printer, or if I am creating something for video or the Web, it is a pretty amazing piece of professional software.  What is more amazing is that the software is open source, meaning people from all over the planet contribute code to the software to make it do amazing new things.

And in addition to that, like most open source projects, it is also free, as in "download a copy at no cost to you ... it is free to use in any situation." And it is competitive. Feature for feature, it is packed with what you can find in software that currently costs thousands of dollars.

The neat thing is that you can "buy" items and "invest" in their cloud-based training and I did all of it...

* Bought (what I thought was) a cup (ended up being a set of four)
* Bought a t-shirt
* Invested in monthly cloud services (which includes training and 3D assets and textures)

It is a fun way to invest in the future and keep things rolling on the stuff you love!
