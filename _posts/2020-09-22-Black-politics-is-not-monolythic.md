title: Black Politics is not monolythic
---
I've had many conversations about how the black community is not a monolyth when it comes to political alignment. Most recently, I have a conversation that highlighted the idea that the only way to deal with the issue of racism required voting for liberal political candidates. I took exception.

Specifically, it was said that conservatives are not all racist, but that they don't see racism as a show-stopper. I posed the idea that black conservatives seem pretty passionate about reducing racism while not agreeing with the idea that liberals are the only way to care about racism. The response that came back was the simile that _abused spouses still stick with their abusers_ implying black republicans are abused by the republicans with which they are affiliated.

This article is about listening to conservative black voices. They do not deny racism exists. They tend to not agree with popular liberal assumptions about institutional racism (some have publically said that they believe the existance of some forms of institutional racism is real but do not believe all racism is institutional and feel it is important to parse the difference.) And they believe that the liberal agenda both historically promoted classic institutional racism and that the modern liberal agenda abuses the issue to exploit black concerns without producing helpful solutions. These voices tend to promote solutions wrapped in opportunity rather than class-warfare designed for exploitation.

The pattern I have seen the most in my conversations is that a large majority of people who advocate for liberal political class warfare on the issue of racism have not listened to black conservative voices... nearly at all. In fact, the media do not tend to promote them, so yes, you have to be intentional in your search. 

The same is generally true of black history. With the exception of a few commonly mentioned black historical figured that support modern liberal talking-points and a list of black names of people who we might deem victims (often rightly so), black conservative voices are not promoted because they do not feed the liberal agenda of race-based class warfare. So those voices are lost to history.

Well, rest assured, they do exist, and in large numbers, and here is a short list of very modern names and links, followed by an even longer list of extremely popular sports figures, politicians, writers, actors, and commentators.

The list goes on and on and on and it should be worth noting I've intentionally left out many very recognizable popular black voices here:

* Michael Steele
* Condoleezza Rice
* Colin Powell
* Tim Scott
* Clarence Thomas
* Herman Cain
* Candace Owens
* Alan keys
* Ben Carson
* Don King
* Karl Malone
* Stacey Dash
* Sheryl Underwood
* Lynn Swann
* T.D. Jakes
* Jimmie Walker
* Thomas Sowell
* Alveda King
* Amy Holms
* Stephen L. Carter
* Joseph C Phillips
* Dick Parsons
* Carol Miller Swain
* Charles Payne

... and dear glorious heaven the list goes on and on and on. All it takes is searching for conservative black voices to know there is no shortage of brilliant black conservatives.

I am confident the above people would feel fully offended if someone stood before them and informed them that either...

1. For as long as they stay conservative, they are like an abused spouse unwilling to leave their abuser, or...
2. They don't "get" racism, or...
3. Liberal Politicians are the only group trying to solve racism

I believe in fighting racism. I think I might just disagree with some on how to actually do that, how much of that is politically solvable at a Federal and State level, and I might disagree with some on what has historically worked and what has historically failed in the fight against racism and how those successes and failures align with Democrat and Republican historical agendas.
