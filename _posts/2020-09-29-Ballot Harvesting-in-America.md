title: Ballot Harvesting in 2020 America
---
It isn't a concern at this point. It is a fact. The only way you might not know would be if you were only listening to liberal press. One thing is clear so far. The Democrats are already poised to take advantage of mail-in ballots and so far their arrogant rants are exposing their evil deads.

I am not going to explain any of it. The ends certainly do not justify the means. I did a recent search in media for ballot harvesting, something the press and Democrat candidates have been saying just isn't a problem, and not only are there countless historical videos of news organizations exposing ballot harvesting, but there are immediate contemporary examples of people getting caught this very year.

Here are some recent news and video articles and content to get your dander up, along with some not so distant examples that prove it is a problem in 2020 and it has been for a very long time.

While you might be able to find a few examples of Republicans involved in ballot fraud throughout history, it doesn't come close to the reality of the number of cases where Democrats were either committing fraud or illegally harvesting, including specifically paying people to harvest ballots and/or commit fraud.

Below are examples across the United States, from Florida to California, Connecticut to Washington State, and midwest states in between.
