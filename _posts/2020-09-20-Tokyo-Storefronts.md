title: "Tokyo Storefronts book by Mateusz Urbanowicz"
---
I recently picked up a book of watercool art and I love it. Most books I buy these days are digital. The exceptions are a few books where I either have anticipated loving the book for some time, it is a new book I am looking forward to, or great art books.

%}The artist wandered around Tokyo and did these amazing little sketches of different storefronts and then turned them into beautiful watercolor paintings.

%}For each building the author takes you in for a closer look on some details. The notes are written in both English and Japanese, which is neat.

%}The index of the book looks amazing with extra details, but I really enjoy the map Mateusz Urbanowicz created that shows you where the storefront could be found historically. And if you have ever lived in a city, you know that businesses in locations do not last forever, so it is also a nice snapshot and omage to the time and place for these fine establishments.

If you are interested in the subject matter then I highly recommend you go pickup [Tokyo Storefronts by Mateusz Urbanowicz](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/484436734X/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1){:.external}
