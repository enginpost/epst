I am not, by any imagination, experienced with modelling. But, it looked like a lot of fun, so I got on amazon and went for it.

I explain the process of modelling and then casting a rubber mold and then creating resin casting from the rubber mold. It was a lot of fun and now I am just looking for more sculpture ideas to do another one.

Check out the video:
