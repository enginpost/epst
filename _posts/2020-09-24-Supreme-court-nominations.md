title: Supreme Court Nominations In An Election Year
---
There is a bit of discussion about whether or not it seems legitimate or illigitimate for a president to fill a Supreme Court justice seat during an election year. I feel like we need to unpack that as well as briefly look at some history to put that very real question in context.

## Is it proper for a president to fill a Supreme Court seat during an election year?

Arguments for waiting:

* Some people would prefer we wait for the will of the people to resolve with regard to the soon elected president, before the current president who may not be re-elected, makes such a nomination.
* Republicans were _for waiting_ (2016), before they were _against waiting_ (2020)

Arguments against waiting:

* Democrats were _against waiting_ (2016), before they were _for waiting_ (2020)
* Ruth Bader Ginsburg said _"The president is elected for four years, not three years. So the power he has in year three continues into year four. Maybe members of the Senate will wake-up and appreciate that that's how it should be."_ (2016)

## Historical facts about this process during an election year

* Filling a Supreme Court vacancy during an election year has occured **29 times in US history**
* **Half of all US Presidents** in US history have made nominations during election years with no problems
* For **19 of 20 times, The US Senate and the President were affiliated with the same party**
* Of the 19 times when the US Senate and the US President were of the same party, **17 nominations were confirmed in the election year**
* **10 times in US history**, a US President of a party different from the majority party controlling the US Senate nominated a Supreme Court candidate _during an election year_
* Of those 10 times **where the President and the US Senate did not share a party affiliation, only 2 confirmations occured**.

## Conclusion:

There is historically no increased likelihood of a presidential nomination being either taken up or confirmed in an election year where the president and the party controlling the senate are not the same party. Said another way...

* Democrats and Republicans controlling the senate are _**not very likely to confirm**_ a presidential candidate _**where their party affiliation is not a match**_ during an election year.

* At the same time, Democrats and Republicans _**are much more likely to confirm**_ presidential Supreme Court nominations during an election year _**when the party affiliation is the same and the candidate is qualified**_.
